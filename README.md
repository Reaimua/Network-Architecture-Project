# Network Architecture Diagram

## Overview
This Diagram was created in the attempt to gain a deeper understanding of the importance, use cases and overall structure of 2 and 3-tier network architectures. This project was done as the second part of the [6 Month Cloud Study Plan](https://www.madebygps.com/cloudcamp/) and serves as another step towards gaining valuable skills towards understanding and implementing cloud technologies. 

## 3-Tier Architecture
### Description
The 3-Tier Network Architecture comprises three distinct layers to establish a seamless connection for end users to the internet. This well-structured configuration encompasses the **Access, Distribution, and Core Layers**, each playing a vital role in ensuring efficient and reliable network functionality.
#### Access Layer
The access layer serves as the initial point of connection for end-user devices. It acts as the gateway, facilitating integration of devices such as computers, smartphones, and other endpoints into the broader network infrastructure. The main focus of the access layer is to provide connectivity for users to access and interact with the rest of the network. 
#### Distribution Layer
The distribution layer functions as the middleman between the access and core layers. It is responsible for managing and directing network traffic and optimizing communication between various parts of the network.
