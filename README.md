# Network Architecture Diagram

This repository contains network architecture diagrams representing both 2-tier and 3-tier architectures for a scalable and resilient system.

## Overview

The network architecture diagrams illustrate the organization and communication flow within a multi-tiered system. Each architecture provides distinct advantages in terms of scalability, performance, and separation of concerns.

## 2-Tier Architecture

### Description

The 2-tier architecture, also known as a client-server architecture, consists of two main components: the client and the server. In this model, the client directly communicates with the server, typically involving a presentation layer (client) and a database layer (server).

### Components

1. **Client Layer:**
   - Represents the user interface or application interface that interacts directly with the server.
   
2. **Server Layer:**
   - Houses the application's business logic and interacts with the database.

### Benefits

- Simplicity: Fewer layers make the architecture easy to manage.
- Direct Communication: Clients communicate directly with the server.

## 3-Tier Architecture

### Description

The 3-tier architecture introduces an additional layer, the application layer, between the client and server layers. This separation allows for more flexibility, scalability, and modularization.

### Components

1. **Client Layer:**
   - Represents the user interface or application interface.

2. **Application Layer:**
   - Contains the application server or business logic, handling processing tasks and acting as an intermediary between the client and the server.

3. **Server Layer:**
   - Houses the database and handles data storage and retrieval.

### Benefits

- Scalability: Components can scale independently, enhancing system scalability.
- Modularization: Separation of concerns improves maintainability.
- Flexibility: Changes in one layer don't directly impact the others.
